We will not train a real model (there is no denoising network yet — that is the capstone lesson). Instead, you will write the **data preparation and loss computation** steps as a function.\n\n**Note:** This exercise builds on the code patterns from Exercises 1 and 2. If you skipped them, make sure to run the Shared Setup cells first and review how the closed-form formula is applied in Exercise 1 and how MSE is computed in Exercise 2.\n\nThe DDPM training algorithm has seven steps:\n1. **Sample** a training image $x_0$ from the dataset\n2. **Sample** a random timestep $t \\sim \\text{Uniform}(1, T)$\n3. **Sample** noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$\n4. **Create** the noisy image: $x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\cdot x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\cdot \\epsilon$\n5. **Predict**: $\\hat{\\epsilon} = \\text{network}(x_t, t)$\n6. **Compute loss**: $L = \\text{MSE}(\\hat{\\epsilon}, \\epsilon)$\n7. **Backpropagate** and update weights\n\nSteps 1-4 are the diffusion-specific data preparation. Steps 5-7 are the standard training loop you already know.\n\n**Task:** Fill in the three TODO markers below. Each is 1-2 lines of code.\n\n<details>\n<summary>💡 Solution</summary>\n\nThe key insight: the DDPM training loop is the standard training loop with diffusion-specific data preparation. The three TODOs are the three diffusion-specific sampling steps — everything else is the familiar forward-loss-backward-update pattern.\n\n```python\n# TODO 1: Sample a random timestep for each image in the batch\nt = torch.randint(1, T, (batch_size,))\n\n# TODO 2: Sample fresh noise (the \"answer key\")\nepsilon = torch.randn_like(x_0)\n\n# TODO 3: Create the noisy image using the closed-form formula\n# Gather the right alpha_bar for each image's timestep, reshape for broadcasting\nalpha_bar_t = alpha_bar[t].view(batch_size, 1, 1, 1)\nx_t = torch.sqrt(alpha_bar_t) * x_0 + torch.sqrt(1 - alpha_bar_t) * epsilon\n```\n\nNote the `.view(batch_size, 1, 1, 1)` — this reshapes alpha_bar from `[batch_size]` to `[batch_size, 1, 1, 1]` so it broadcasts correctly against the image tensor `[batch_size, 1, 28, 28]`. Each image in the batch gets its own alpha_bar value based on its randomly sampled timestep.\n\n</details>"

This is why the closed-form formula matters — it lets you teleport to any noise level without iterating through intermediate steps."

    "**Middle timesteps tend to have the highest loss.** Here is the reasoning for each regime:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low $t$ (easy in a different way):** The image is nearly clean. The noise is a tiny perturbation — like a light dusting of static on a clear photo. The network can see the image clearly, but the noise is so subtle that precisely predicting every noise value is difficult. However, the noise *magnitude* is small, so the squared errors are also small. Low MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High $t$ (somewhat predictable):** The image is almost pure noise. There is very little signal left. But this means $x_t \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\cdot \\epsilon$, so the noisy image *is* mostly the noise (scaled). The network can make a reasonable guess just from $x_t$ itself. Moderate MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middle $t$ (hardest):** This is where signal and noise are roughly balanced. The network cannot ignore either component. It must simultaneously understand the image content (to subtract the signal) AND estimate the noise pattern. This ambiguity creates the most room for error. Highest MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition: at the extremes, one of the two components (signal or noise) dominates and the problem simplifies. In the middle, neither dominates — maximum ambiguity, maximum difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In practice, a real trained model's loss landscape is shaped by the specific architecture, dataset, and training dynamics. The general pattern (middle timesteps being hardest) is widely observed, though the exact curve varies.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The closed-form formula is a training tool.** You use $x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\cdot x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\cdot \\epsilon$ to create noisy images at arbitrary timesteps — no iterating through intermediate steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The DDPM loss is MSE.** The same formula, the same `nn.MSELoss()`, the same gradients as every MSE computation since Series 1. The only difference: prediction = predicted noise, target = actual noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The training loop is the standard loop with diffusion-specific data preparation.** Steps 1-4 (sample image, sample timestep, sample noise, create noisy image) are new. Steps 5-7 (forward pass, loss, backward, update) are the same heartbeat from Series 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Each image in a batch gets a random timestep.** No sequential order. The closed-form formula lets training teleport to any noise level efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Difficulty varies with the timestep.** Low noise = subtle perturbations. High noise = hallucinating structure. Middle noise = maximum ambiguity. Same algorithm handles all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental model:** Same building blocks, different question. The building blocks: MSE loss, backprop, gradient descent. The question: \"what noise was added to this image?\""
