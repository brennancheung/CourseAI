This is the payoff.\n",

   "source": "<details>\n<summary>💡 Solution</summary>\n\nThe key insight: all three schedulers use the same trained U-Net weights. The model's prediction (noise) is the same. The schedulers differ in *how they use that prediction to step from z_t to z_{t-1}*. Different numerical methods follow different paths through the same trajectory, producing similar but not identical images.\n\n```python\n    # Set the scheduler\n    pipe.scheduler = scheduler_cls.from_config(scheduler_config)\n\n    # Same seed for fair comparison\n    generator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(seed)\n\n    start = time.time()\n\n    result = pipe(\n        prompt,\n        num_inference_steps=num_steps,\n        guidance_scale=guidance_scale,\n        generator=generator,\n        height=512,\n        width=512,\n    )\n```\n\n**What to observe:**\n- The three images depict the same scene but with subtle differences in composition, color, and detail.\n- DPM-Solver++ at 25 steps is likely fastest (fewest steps, higher-order solver).\n- DDIM at 50 steps takes roughly twice as long (twice the steps, first-order solver).\n- Euler at 30 steps is in between.\n- The quality is comparable across all three. The \"same vehicle, different route\" analogy holds.\n\n**Common mistakes:**\n1. **Forgetting to re-seed the generator.** Without creating a fresh `torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(seed)` for each scheduler, z_T differs between runs, making the comparison meaningless. The generator's state is consumed during sampling and cannot be reused.\n2. **Generator device mismatch.** If the pipeline is on CUDA but you create `torch.Generator(\"cpu\").manual_seed(seed)`, you will get an error or silently incorrect results. Always match the generator's device to the pipeline: `torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(seed)` where `device` matches `pipe.device`. This is a frequent diffusers stumbling block.\n\n</details>\n\n---"

    "**Hypothesis:** Adding a negative prompt \"blurry, low quality, deformed, watermark\" will produce a noticeably sharper, cleaner image than generating without a negative prompt—not by removing blur from the image, but by steering the entire generation trajectory away from blurry outputs from step 1 onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this hypothesis:** The negative prompt replaces the empty-string unconditional embedding in the CFG formula. Instead of ε_cfg = ε_uncond + w · (ε_cond − ε_uncond), it becomes ε_cfg = ε_neg + w · (ε_cond − ε_neg). The generation is steered AWAY from the negative prompt's semantic direction at every step.

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Every parameter maps to a concept you built from scratch.** `prompt` → CLIP encoding → cross-attention. `guidance_scale` → CFG *w* parameter. `num_inference_steps` → sampler step count along the ODE trajectory. `scheduler` → sampler choice. `negative_prompt` → CFG unconditional substitution. `generator` → seed → z_T. `height`/`width` → latent dimensions via VAE 8× downsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`guidance_scale` is a tradeoff, not a quality dial.** Low values produce soft, prompt-unfaithful images. High values produce oversaturated, distorted images. The sweet spot (~7–8) balances prompt fidelity with image naturalness. This is the CFG formula made visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DPM-Solver++ plateaus at 20–30 steps.** More steps past the sweet spot waste compute with negligible quality improvement. The default of 50 in many tutorials is a conservative holdover from DDIM. Use 20–25 steps as your default.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Systematic experimentation beats random exploration.** Fix everything except one parameter, vary it, observe the effect. Start with defaults (DPM-Solver++ at 25 steps, guidance_scale=7.5, 512×512) and refine from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The API is a dashboard, not a black box.** You did not follow a tutorial. You understood the system. Every parameter change had a predictable effect because you built the underlying concepts across 16 lessons."
