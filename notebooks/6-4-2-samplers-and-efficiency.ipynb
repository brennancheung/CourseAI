   "source": "### What Just Happened\n\nYou verified two fundamental properties of the samplers:\n\n- **DDIM is deterministic** (σ=0): all three runs with the same seed produced pixel-identical images. The predict-x₀-then-jump mechanism uses no random noise during sampling. Given the same starting noise z_T, the trajectory to z_0 is fully determined by the model's predictions at each step. This is why DDIM is valuable for reproducibility, A/B testing, and interpolation in z_T space.\n\n- **DDPM is stochastic**: the three runs produced different images even though they started from the same generator seed. Why? Because the generator was seeded once and its internal state advanced after each run. DDPM injects fresh random noise at every step—the σ_t · z term in the reverse formula. Each pipeline call consumed dozens of random draws (one per step for the noise injection, plus one for z_T). By the second run, the generator was in a different state, producing a different z_T and different per-step noise. The result: three distinct images from the same starting seed.\n\n- **Note on quality:** DDPM was designed for 1000 steps. At 50 steps (used here for speed), quality is lower. That quality difference is about step count, not about stochastic vs deterministic. The stochasticity claim is about *diversity*—different images from different random states—which holds regardless of step count.\n\nThe temperature analogy from **Sampling and Generation** applies directly: DDIM is temperature=0 (deterministic, always picks the \"most likely\" path). DDPM is temperature>0 (stochastic, explores diverse paths). Same model, same destination, but DDPM wanders while DDIM strides.\n\n---"

DPM-Solver achieves good quality by ~20 steps, and adding more steps beyond that yields diminishing returns. This is because the higher-order solver accounts for trajectory curvature, allowing large accurate steps.\n\n**Cell 1 — Generation loop (replace `result = None`):**\n```python\nresult = pipe(\n    prompt,\n    num_inference_steps=n,\n    guidance_scale=guidance_scale,\n    generator=generator,\n)\n```\n\n**Cell 2 — Time-vs-steps plot (replace `# YOUR CODE HERE`):**\n```python\nplt.plot(step_counts, step_timings, 'o-', color='cyan', linewidth=2, markersize=8)\nplt.xlabel('Number of Steps')\nplt.ylabel('Generation Time (s)')\nplt.title('DPM-Solver: Generation Time vs Step Count')\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nfor n, t in zip(step_counts, step_timings):\n    plt.annotate(f'{t:.1f}s', (n, t), textcoords='offset points',\n                 xytext=(0, 10), ha='center', fontsize=9)\n```\n\n**What to observe:**\n- 5 steps: likely garbled or very blurry. Even DPM-Solver cannot follow a 1000-timestep trajectory accurately in 5 jumps.\n- 10 steps: recognizable but missing fine details. The coarse structure (layout, colors) is established but textures are mushy.\n- 20 steps: good quality. The sweet spot for DPM-Solver. This is why 20–30 is the recommended range.\n- 50–200 steps: nearly indistinguishable from 20 steps. Diminishing returns.\n\nGeneration time scales approximately linearly with step count because each step requires 2 U-Net forward passes (CFG). The fixed overhead (CLIP encoding, VAE decoding, pipeline setup) is small relative to the denoising loop.\n\n</details>\n\n---"

    "## Exercise 4: Inspect DDIM Intermediates [Independent]\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson's trajectory perspective says that sampling traces a path from noise to data. DDIM follows a smooth, deterministic trajectory. DDPM follows a jittery, stochastic path. At each step, the latent z_t contains progressively more structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task:\n",
    "1. Generate an image with **DDIM at 10 steps**, extracting and storing the **intermediate latent z_t at every step** (10 intermediates total)\n",
    "2. **VAE-decode each intermediate latent** to visualize the coarse-to-fine progression\n",
    "3. Generate an image with **DDPM at 10 steps**, extracting the same intermediates\n",
    "4. Display both sets of intermediates side by side\n",
    "5. **Reflection:** Why does DDIM at 10 steps produce recognizable intermediates while DDPM at 10 steps looks much worse?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key tips:**\n",
    "- Use `pipe()` with `output_type='latent'` to get the final latent (but you need intermediates at EVERY step, not just the final one)\n",
    "- To capture intermediates, use the `callback_on_step_end` parameter. The callback receives `(pipe, step_index, timestep, callback_kwargs)` and the current latent is in `callback_kwargs['latents']`\n",
    "- Or, run the denoising loop manually (like the reference notebook Exercise 3) and store z_t at each step\n",
    "- Use the `latent_to_pil()` helper to decode latents to images\n",
    "- Use the same prompt and seed for both DDIM and DDPM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected output:** Two rows of 10 images. The DDIM row should show a smooth progression from noise to a recognizable image. The DDPM row should show a noisier, less coherent progression (because DDPM was designed for 1000 steps, not 10)."

Each step makes a large, accurate leap along the trajectory.

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The model predicts noise. The sampler decides what to do with that prediction.** DDPM takes tiny adjacent steps (1000 steps, stochastic). DDIM predicts x₀ and leaps using the closed-form formula (50 steps, deterministic). DPM-Solver reads trajectory curvature with multiple evaluations (20 steps, current standard). All use the exact same trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No retraining. Same weights. Different walkers.** Swapping `pipe.scheduler` is one line of code. The model’s job (predict noise) never changes. The sampler’s job (decide how to step) is the only variable. You verified this by generating comparable images with three different schedulers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DDIM is deterministic; DDPM is stochastic.** Same seed with DDIM produces pixel-identical images every time (σ=0, no per-step noise injection). DDPM injects fresh noise at every step, producing diverse but non-reproducible results. This is the temperature analogy from Sampling and Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quality vs steps is highly nonlinear for advanced samplers.** DPM-Solver achieves good quality at ~20 steps. Adding more steps beyond the sweet spot yields diminishing returns. Use the recommended range: DPM-Solver++ at 20–30 steps as your default.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **DDIM’s predict-and-leap mechanism handles large step sizes; DDPM’s adjacent-step formula does not.** The intermediate inspection exercise showed this concretely: DDIM at 10 steps produces a smooth coarse-to-fine trajectory, while DDPM at 10 steps produces accumulating artifacts because its formula was calibrated for tiny transitions."
