The results demonstrate the lesson's central practical point:\n\n- **Too many edges (50, 100):** Texture details, noise, and grain all become edges. ControlNet tries to follow every spurious contour, producing over-constrained, artifacted output.\n- **Good edges (100, 200):** Clean structural edges capture object boundaries and composition. ControlNet follows the composition precisely while the text prompt fills in natural-looking details.\n- **Too few edges (200, 300):** Only the strongest gradients survive. The model lacks sufficient spatial guidance—the result is loosely controlled, with the composition only roughly matching.\n\n**The threshold tuning was the most impactful decision.** The same ControlNet checkpoint, the same prompt, the same seed—only the preprocessing changed, and the output quality varied dramatically.\n\n---"

   "source": "<details>\n<summary>💡 Solution</summary>\n\nThe key insight is that `controlnet_conditioning_scale` is a single parameter in the pipeline call—your manual volume knob for spatial control. The sweep loop is just calling the pipeline with a different scale value each time.\n\n```python\nfor scale in scales:\n    generator = make_generator(seed)\n    result = pipe(\n        prompt,\n        image=best_canny_map,\n        num_inference_steps=num_steps,\n        generator=generator,\n        controlnet_conditioning_scale=scale,\n    ).images[0]\n    sweep_results[scale] = result\n```\n\n**Why this works:** The conditioning scale multiplies the ControlNet's output features before they are added to the frozen encoder's skip connections. At scale=0, the ControlNet's contribution is zeroed out (muted). At scale=1.0, it is at full trained strength. Above 1.0, you are amplifying the signal beyond what training optimized for, which is why over-constraining occurs.\n\n**Common mistake:** Forgetting to recreate the generator for each scale value. Without resetting the seed, each generation starts from different random noise, making the comparison unfair—you would not be isolating the effect of the scale parameter.\n\n</details>\n\n### What Just Happened\n\nYou swept the conditioning scale from 0.3 to 2.0 and discovered the control-creativity tradeoff firsthand:\n\n- **Low scales (0.3–0.5):** The spatial map is a faint suggestion. The model generates mostly from the text prompt, with rough composition loosely following the edges.\n- **Sweet spot (0.7–1.0):** Clear structural adherence with natural textures. The model follows the composition precisely while maintaining the visual quality you expect from SD.\n- **High scales (1.5–2.0):** Over-constrained. Textures flatten, details stiffen, the image looks mechanical. The model is trying too hard to match every edge pixel.\n\nYou also verified that **text conditioning remains active** at scale=1.0. Two different prompts with the same edge map produced the same structure but completely different content. The WHEN/WHAT/WHERE channels coexist—conditioning scale turns up the WHERE volume, it does not mute the WHAT channel.\n\n---"

The pipeline handles the rest (running each ControlNet independently and summing their additive features at the skip connections).\n\n**Building the stacked pipeline:**\n```python\npipe_stacked = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\n    controlnet=[controlnet_canny, controlnet_depth],\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    safety_checker=None,\n).to(device)\npipe_stacked.scheduler = UniPCMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe_stacked.scheduler.config)\n```\n\n**Generating with the stacked pipeline:**\n```python\ngenerator = make_generator(seed)\nimg_stacked = pipe_stacked(\n    prompt,\n    image=[best_canny_map, depth_map],\n    num_inference_steps=num_steps,\n    generator=generator,\n    controlnet_conditioning_scale=[0.7, 0.5],\n).images[0]\n```\n\n**Why moderate scales (0.7 and 0.5)?** Each ControlNet independently contributes additive features. Their combined effect at the skip connections is `e_i + z_i_canny + z_i_depth`. If both are at scale 1.0, the combined spatial constraint can be too strong, producing artifacts. Starting with moderate scales (0.5–0.8) gives each map influence while leaving room for the model to generate natural details.\n\n**Why Canny at 0.7 and depth at 0.5?** Canny edges provide fine-grained contour control that is visually precise—you want this signal to be reasonably strong. Depth provides broad spatial layering—a softer influence is usually sufficient. You could tune these differently depending on your creative intent.\n\n**Common mistake:** Passing `image=best_canny_map` (a single image) instead of `image=[best_canny_map, depth_map]` (a list). When you have multiple ControlNets, the pipeline expects a list of conditioning images—one per ControlNet.\n\n</details>\n\n### What Just Happened\n\nYou stacked two ControlNets—Canny edges and depth—and compared the result to each individual ControlNet:\n\n- **Canny only:** Precise contour control. Object boundaries and silhouettes match the edges. But depth and perspective are the model's choice.\n- **Depth only:** Correct spatial layering and perspective. But specific contours are loosely controlled.\n- **Stacked:** Both contours AND layering are controlled. The combination is more precisely controlled than either alone because the two maps provide **complementary** structural information.\n\nThe stacked result is not \"2x more controlled.\" It is controlled in two different ways simultaneously—edges enforce contours while depth enforces layering. This is the additive composition from the architecture: `e_i + z_i_canny + z_i_depth`.\n\n---"

Stacking both gives precise contour control AND correct perspective.\n\n```python\n# Choose source image\nmy_image = download_sample_image(image_options[\"architecture\"], \"my_source.jpg\")\nmy_image = my_image.resize((512, 512))\n\n# Preprocess: Canny edges\nmy_edges = cv2.Canny(np.array(my_image), 100, 200)\nmy_canny = Image.fromarray(np.stack([my_edges] * 3, axis=-1))\n\n# Preprocess: depth map\nfrom transformers import pipeline as hf_pipeline\ndepth_est = hf_pipeline(\"depth-estimation\", model=\"Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas\")\nmy_depth = depth_est(my_image)[\"depth\"].resize((512, 512))\ndel depth_est; gc.collect(); torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n\n# Load stacked pipeline\ncn_canny = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained(\n    \"lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-canny\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\ncn_depth = ControlNetModel.from_pretrained(\n    \"lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-depth\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\npipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5\",\n    controlnet=[cn_canny, cn_depth],\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    safety_checker=None,\n).to(device)\npipe.scheduler = UniPCMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)\n\n# Generate\ngenerator = make_generator(42)\nresult = pipe(\n    \"a fantasy castle in a magical forest, digital art, detailed\",\n    image=[my_canny, my_depth],\n    num_inference_steps=20,\n    generator=generator,\n    controlnet_conditioning_scale=[0.7, 0.5],\n).images[0]\n\n# Display\nshow_images(\n    [my_image, my_canny, my_depth, result],\n    [\"Source\", \"Canny Edges\", \"Depth Map\", \"Generated\"],\n    suptitle=\"Stacked Canny + Depth: contours AND perspective controlled\",\n)\n\n# Clean up\ncleanup_pipeline(pipe)\ndel cn_canny, cn_depth\n```\n\n**Key decisions:**\n- Canny thresholds (100, 200) because the building has clear geometric edges at moderate contrast\n- Stacking because architecture benefits from both contour precision (Canny) and perspective accuracy (depth)\n- Canny at 0.7 (strong contours matter for architecture), depth at 0.5 (softer spatial layering)\n- The prompt describes the creative transformation while the spatial maps lock down the composition\n\n</details>"

Bad Canny thresholds produce noisy edges; noisy edges produce artifacted output. Garbage in, garbage out. Tune the preprocessing before touching anything else.\n\n2. **The pipeline API is identical for all spatial map types.** Only the preprocessor and the ControlNet checkpoint change. `StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline` does not know or care what kind of map it receives. The architecture is genuinely map-agnostic.\n\n3. **Conditioning scale is your volume knob for spatial control.** Low scale = spatial map is a suggestion. High scale = model rigidly follows the map. Sweet spot is typically 0.7–1.0. Same tradeoff as CFG guidance scale—precision vs creativity. Two knobs on the same mixing board.\n\n4. **Multiple ControlNets stack by summing their additive features.** Use complementary maps from the same source image, moderate scales (0.5–0.8 each), and add complexity gradually. Stacking is not \"2x control\"—it is two different types of control simultaneously.\n\n5. **The practical workflow is: choose image → choose preprocessor(s) → tune preprocessing → tune conditioning scale → iterate.** This is a creative process. The tools are the same every time; the decisions are what change."
