The second half: use the critique to generate a *revised* response, then pair the original and revised responses as a preference pair. The revised response is preferred over the original. This preference pair is the training data that constitutional AI generates at scale.\n\nYou'll implement the revision step and construct the preference pair. The result is exactly the kind of data that would be used to train a reward model (RLAIF) or directly for SFT.\n\nFill in the TODOs below.

Here you'll build your own version (`my_generate_revision`) to understand the prompt construction.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Hint</summary>\n\nThe revision step asks the model to rewrite its response to address the specific problems identified in the critique.

This is the same format as human preference data in RLHF — just generated by AI instead of human annotators.\n\nCommon mistake: thinking the revision needs to be perfect. It just needs to be *better* than the original along the dimension defined by the principle. The preference is relative (revised > original), not absolute.\n\n</details>"

    "\n",
    "1. **Principles steer the critique.** Different constitutional principles produce different critiques of the same response. The principle defines *what dimension* of quality to evaluate, giving the AI feedback specific direction that human annotators apply implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critique-and-revision generates training data, not inference-time behavior.** The output of the loop is a preference pair (revised > original) — the same format as RLHF data. The model trained on this data produces good responses directly, with no critique step at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The mechanism is the same at any scale.** We ran the critique-and-revision loop manually on single examples. Constitutional AI runs it thousands of times across different prompts and principles. The mechanism is identical; the scale produces enough training data to align a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Principle quality determines alignment quality.** Vague or poorly-designed principles produce vague critiques and weak revisions. The alignment challenge shifts from \"find enough human annotators\" to \"design the right principles.\" The editor gets a style guide — but only if the style guide is well-written.\n",
