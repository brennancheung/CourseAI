    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ControlNet adds ~35–40% of the U-Net's parameters, not 100%.** The trainable copy is the encoder half only. The frozen decoder runs once, receiving enriched skip connections from both the frozen encoder and the ControlNet copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Zero convolutions are standard 1×1 convs with zero initialization.** The output is exactly zero before training. Adding zero to the frozen features leaves them unchanged: $e_i + 0 = e_i$. The control signal fades in gradually as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ControlNet produces multi-resolution features that match the frozen encoder's shapes exactly.** Each output is added at the corresponding skip connection. The only change to the forward pass is $e_i + z_i$ instead of $e_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Text and spatial conditioning coexist.** Same edge map + different prompts = same structure, different content. Timestep says WHEN. Text says WHAT. ControlNet says WHERE. Three conditioning signals, three mechanisms, all active simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The frozen model is never modified.** Disconnect the ControlNet and the output is vanilla SD, bit-for-bit identical. This is the same safety principle as LoRA's B=0 initialization, applied at the feature level."
