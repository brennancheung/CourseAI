   "source": "<details>\n<summary>💡 Solution</summary>\n\nThe key insight is that inpainting is the standard denoising loop plus a per-step mask. The mask tells the model which regions to denoise and which to preserve. Mask sizing matters because the model needs spatial context around the edited region to produce coherent boundaries.\n\n**TODO 1--Create the generous mask:**\n```python\ngenerous_mask = Image.new('L', (512, 512), 0)\ngenerous_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(generous_mask)\ngenerous_draw.rectangle([0, 0, 512, 240], fill=255)  # 40px more than tight mask\n```\nWhy extend by 40 pixels? The lesson noted that slightly oversized masks produce better results because the model has room to create smooth transitions. The tight mask cuts exactly at the sky-mountain boundary, leaving no room for blending. The generous mask extends into the mountains slightly, letting the model handle the transition.\n\n**TODO 2--Run inpainting:**\n```python\ngenerator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(seed)\ntight_result = inpaint_pipe(\n    prompt=inpaint_prompt,\n    image=source_image,\n    mask_image=tight_mask,\n    guidance_scale=7.5,\n    num_inference_steps=30,\n    generator=generator,\n).images[0]\n\ngenerator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(seed)\ngenerous_result = inpaint_pipe(\n    prompt=inpaint_prompt,\n    image=source_image,\n    mask_image=generous_mask,\n    guidance_scale=7.5,\n    num_inference_steps=30,\n    generator=generator,\n).images[0]\n```\nNote the re-seeded generator for each call. Same seed ensures the random noise is identical, so differences between tight and generous results come only from the mask size.\n\n**Common mistakes:**\n- Forgetting to re-create the generator between pipeline calls. The first call consumes the random state.\n- Using `mode='RGB'` instead of `mode='L'` for the mask. The pipeline expects a single-channel mask.\n- Inverting the mask convention: white (255) means \"edit here\", black (0) means \"preserve.\" Some implementations use the opposite convention.\n\n</details>"

    "\n",
    "2. **Boundaries blend naturally.** Even with the tight mask, the boundary is far smoother than you would get from cut-and-paste. This is because the U-Net sees the full latent at every denoising step. At the 8x8 bottleneck, each position has global receptive field—the model's predictions for the sky region near the boundary account for the mountain context.\n",

    "**Why strength=0.75 for the sketch?** The sketch is very rough—it needs substantial creative reinterpretation. Low strength (0.3) would preserve the sketch's flat colors and hard edges. High strength (0.75) lets the model reimagine the details while keeping the broad spatial composition. This connects to the coarse-to-fine mental model: at strength=0.75, the model runs the structure-setting steps, but the sketch's spatial layout still provides enough guidance to anchor the composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why a generous sky mask?** The lesson noted that slightly oversized masks produce better results. Extending the mask 20-40 pixels below the visible sky-mountain boundary gives the model room to create a smooth, coherent transition between the new clouds and the preserved mountains.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Img2img starts the denoising loop from a noised real image, not pure noise.** The forward process formula you derived in Module 6.2 noises the input to a specific timestep. The strength parameter maps onto the alpha-bar curve—low strength preserves structure (high alpha-bar, mostly signal), high strength allows creative reinterpretation (low alpha-bar, mostly noise). The effect is nonlinear because the alpha-bar curve is nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inpainting adds a per-step spatial mask to the denoising loop.** At each step, masked regions use the model's prediction while unmasked regions are replaced with the re-noised original. Boundaries blend seamlessly because the U-Net sees the full image at every step—its global receptive field at the bottleneck ensures predictions account for surrounding context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neither technique requires training.** No new math, no new architecture, no training loop. Just two clever reconfigurations of the denoising process you already know. The same U-Net, VAE, and CLIP from text-to-image work unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Img2img and inpainting are complementary.** Img2img transforms global composition. Inpainting edits specific regions. Together they form a practical editing pipeline: composition → global transformation → selective refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Same denoising process, different starting point (img2img) or selective application (inpainting).** The pipeline you traced across 17 lessons is unchanged. Img2img moves the starting line. Inpainting adds a spatial filter. Both use the forward process formula—now in its third and fourth applications."
