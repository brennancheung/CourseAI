    "# Red Teaming & Adversarial Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll apply the attack taxonomy and red teaming concepts from the lesson by classifying adversarial prompts, probing an aligned model empirically, and running a toy-scale automated red teaming pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll do:**\n",
    "- Classify 10 adversarial prompts into the six-category attack taxonomy, identifying which mechanism each exploits\n",
    "- Probe an aligned model with direct, reframed, and encoded versions of the same request to map the alignment surface empirically\n",
    "- Build a toy-scale automated red teaming pipeline: generate prompt variations with an LLM, test them, classify responses, and visualize the distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each exercise, PREDICT the output before running the cell.** Wrong predictions are more valuable than correct ones — they reveal gaps in your mental model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** These exercises demonstrate red teaming *methodology*, not attack crafting. We use benign examples (lock-picking, financial advice) where the information is freely available. The goal is understanding *why* aligned models fail at certain points on the input surface, not building a jailbreak toolkit."

    "**Why this works as red teaming:** The 20 variations probe different points on the alignment surface for financial advice. A perfectly aligned model would give appropriately cautious responses to ALL 20 — but in practice, emotionally urgent or leading framings often push the model toward more confident (less cautious) responses. This is the same surface-pattern-matching vulnerability from the attack taxonomy: the model responds to the *tone* of the question, not just the *content*.\n",

    "- Neutral phrasings get cautious responses (alignment training covers this)\n",
    "- \"I've already decided\" framings may get tips instead of risk warnings (sycophancy)\n",

    "- Leading framings may cause the model to agree with the premise (sycophancy again)\n",

    "\n",
    "The insight is the same as the human annotation bottleneck from constitutional AI: manual processes do not scale. A human red teamer might try 5-10 variations. The automated pipeline tested 20 in a few minutes. At production scale, it tests hundreds of thousands. The volume is what finds the subtle failures — not dramatic jailbreaks, but inconsistencies, sycophancy, and context-dependent behavior that affect every user interaction."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The attack taxonomy is a classification framework, not a list to memorize.** Knowing the six categories (direct, indirect, multi-step, encoding, persona, few-shot) tells you what *mechanism* an attack exploits, which tells you what *defense* is needed. Different mechanisms require different defensive strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The alignment surface is empirically uneven.** The same underlying request, presented through different framings, produces different model behaviors. This confirms the lesson's structural argument: alignment training teaches surface pattern matching, not deep intent reasoning. Red teaming maps where the surface holds and where it breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automated red teaming scales the same way RLAIF scales.** Manual red teaming (like Exercise 2) finds obvious failures. Automated red teaming (like Exercise 3) finds subtle inconsistencies at volume. The scaling argument is identical to constitutional AI: humans cannot cover the input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inconsistency is a failure mode as important as jailbreaks.** Exercise 3 likely revealed that the model gives different quality responses to different framings of the same question. This is not a dramatic safety failure — it is a consistency failure that affects every user. Red teaming is broader than jailbreaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The pattern: generate, test, classify, iterate.** This is the automated red teaming loop. At toy scale, you ran it once. At production scale, successful attacks are analyzed for patterns, and the generator creates more attacks targeting discovered weaknesses. Each iteration finds deeper failures."
