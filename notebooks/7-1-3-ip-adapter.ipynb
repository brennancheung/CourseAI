    "The key insight is that the generation call is identical for each prompt—only the text string changes. The IP-Adapter scale and reference image stay fixed. If IP-Adapter replaced text conditioning, all three outputs would be identical regardless of the prompt. The fact that they differ proves decoupling.\n",

    "**Why the outputs differ:** The text K/V path (`W_K_text`, `W_V_text`) processes each prompt independently. Different prompts produce different K_text and V_text tensors, which produce different text attention outputs. The image K/V path (`W_K_image`, `W_V_image`) produces the same image attention output for all three (same reference image). The final output is `text_out + scale × image_out`—different text_out values, same image_out. Hence: different scenes, shared visual character.\n",

    "- **Dog in a snowy forest:** Winter landscape—yet again different content, yet the visual character from the reference is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs are clearly different because the text K/V path is untouched. Each prompt produces different K_text and V_text tensors, creating different text attention outputs. The image K/V path adds the same image influence to all three. This is the practical proof of the lesson's central claim: **image prompting is addition, not replacement.** The two K/V paths run in parallel, and the text prompt retains full control over scene content and composition.\n",

Text provides **WHAT** (semantic content via the original cross-attention). All three are additive and composable—they target different parts of the U-Net.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IP-Adapter is purely additive.** At scale=0, the image branch contributes nothing and the output is identical to vanilla SD. The text K/V path is completely untouched at every scale value. Remove IP-Adapter and the frozen model is bit-for-bit identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The scale parameter is a volume knob for image influence.** The transition from text-dominant (0.0) to image-dominant (1.0) is gradual and continuous. Same \"volume knob\" pattern as ControlNet's conditioning scale—familiar control, new conditioning dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Image prompting is addition, not replacement.** The same reference image with three different text prompts produces three different outputs. Text controls content and composition (WHAT). The reference image controls visual character (WHAT-IT-LOOKS-LIKE). Both K/V paths run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **IP-Adapter and ControlNet are composable.** ControlNet provides spatial structure (WHERE) via additive encoder features. IP-Adapter provides visual identity (WHAT-IT-LOOKS-LIKE) via decoupled cross-attention K/V. Text provides semantic content (WHAT). All three are additive, target different parts of the U-Net, and work together in a single generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The practical workflow is: choose reference image → set scale → compose with other conditioning → iterate.** The tools are the same every time; the creative decisions are what change."
