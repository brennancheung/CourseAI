    "\n",
    "1. **The data format axis is a practical constraint, not a theoretical one.** Converting paired comparisons to single-response labels is lossy — you lose relative ranking and pairing structure. KTO exists because most real feedback is already in single-response format (thumbs-up/down). The method fits the data you have, not the data you wish you had.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The reference model is a stability mechanism, not just extra memory cost.** The log-probability ratio between policy and reference IS the KL constraint. It prevents the policy from drifting too far and forgetting what it learned in pretraining and SFT. Removing it (as ORPO does) requires a different stability mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Offline training data becomes stale as the policy updates.** The distribution mismatch grows with each training step. Online methods regenerate data from the current policy to avoid this, at the cost of additional compute. Most teams use offline methods because the cost/quality tradeoff favors it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The axes are independent.** Data format, reference model, and online vs offline are orthogonal choices. You can combine them in different ways, which is why the design space has many methods — each represents a different combination of tradeoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Alignment techniques are points in a design space, not steps on a ladder.** No method dominates all axes. The right choice depends on your constraints: what data you have, how much memory you can spare, and how much compute you can afford."
