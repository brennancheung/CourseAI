# Course: Deep Learning Foundations

## Goal
Take a software engineer from "uses AI tools" to "understands how models actually work" — building intuition through deliberate practice, interactive exploration, and implementation.

## Progression
Series 1 (Foundations) establishes the complete path from "what is learning?" through linear models, neural networks, and training. Series 2 (PyTorch) bridges theory to practice — hands-on implementation right after the concepts. Series 3 (CNNs) covers convolutional architectures with PyTorch in hand, needed for understanding U-Net in Stable Diffusion. Series 4-7 cover the target domains: LLMs and generative models.
