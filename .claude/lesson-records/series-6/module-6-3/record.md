# Module 6.3: Architecture & Conditioning -- Record

**Goal:** The student understands how the components of Stable Diffusion work individually -- U-Net architecture for multi-scale denoising, timestep and text conditioning mechanisms, CLIP for bridging language and vision, and the move from pixel-space to latent-space diffusion -- well enough to explain why each piece exists and how they connect, preparing for full pipeline assembly in Module 6.4.
